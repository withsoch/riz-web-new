// One family carries display and body. 400/500 do the work, 600/700 cover

// Upright only — the italic cut is deliberately not loaded, because nothing
// on the site is italic any more. globals.css also sets
// font-synthesis-style: none, so a stray font-style: italic renders upright
// rather than being sheared into a faux-oblique.
//
// The variable names the rest of the CSS references are remapped onto this
// one font in globals.css, so pointing them all here is the whole swap. Mono
// is the system stack rather than a second webfont: the only mono on the site
// is 12px instrumentation labels.
