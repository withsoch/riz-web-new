 * BY THE NUMBERS — the board
 *
 * A departure board rather than a list: strict columns with rules between
 * them, a status chip per line, and the reading in the last column where
 * the time would be. One row per company, chronological by start date, so
 * the When column reads as a career rather than as six unrelated dates.
 *
 * Replaces the previous version, which had six evenly spaced rows and a
 * click-to-filter-by-employer control. The filter went with it: it answered
 * a question only Riz has ("which job was this?"), and chronological order
 * already groups the rows the way the filter was grouping them.
